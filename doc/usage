USAGE:
  manhandle [OPTION...] multi-choice [--choice CHOICE]... FILE...
  manhandle [OPTION...] short-answer --action CMD FILE...
  manhandle [OPTION...] fuzzy-finder --action CMD FILE...

DESCRIPTION:
  An ergonomic interface for making manual decisions over lists of files.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
  A navigable sequence of pages is created from the list of filenames. For each
  page, an answer or decision is to be provided via the "decision interface", the
  nature of which is determined by the chosen decision paradigm. Action is then
  taken on the file, incorporating or entirely determined by the decision.
  Actions can be executed immediately at decision time or by writing out at the
  end.

  Several convenience keybinds including file display and a progress pager are
  provided.

OPTIONS:
  --editor EDITOR        This argument overrides envvar $EDITOR.
  --file-pager CMD       Run this in a child shell and open stdout in a pager
                         (default: stat "$MH_FILE").
  --file-display CMD     Run this in a child shell (default: none).
  --execute-immediately  Execute decisions upon entry, instead of waiting to
                         write out.
  --help                 Print this message.

PARADIGM multi-choice:
  Multiple choice binds keys 0-9 to commands through the --choice option.

  Action is taken by executing the selected command. The current file name is
  exported as MH_FILE prior to executing the command.

  OPTIONS:
    --choice CHOICE  Format CHOICE like n:cmd (eg. '1:rm "$MH_FILE"') to bind
                     digit n ([0-9]) to cmd.

PARADIGM short-answer:
  The decision interface is created by executing --editor, EDITOR, or nano (in
  that order of precedence) on a temporary file, which is read (minus a trailing
  newline, if any) as a string.

  Action is taken by executing the --action command, which is required. The
  current file name is exported as MH_FILE and the string is exported as MH_STR
  prior to executing the command.

  OPTIONS:
    --action CMD  This command is executed when taking action (eg. 'mv "$MH_FILE"
                  "$MH_STR"').

PARADIGM fuzzy-finder:
  The decision interface is created by executing the given --fuzzy-finder
  command, which is required, from which standard output is captured (minus a
  trailing newline, if any) as the selection. The current file name is exported
  as MH_FILE prior to executing the command.

  Action is taken by executing the given --action command, which is required.
  The current file name is exported as MH_FILE and the selected string is
  exported as MH_STR prior to executing the command.

  OPTIONS:
    --fuzzy-finder CMD  This command is executed to create the fuzzy finder
                        interface (eg. 'find sync -type d | fzf').
    --action CMD        This command is executed when taking action (eg. 'mv
                        "$MH_FILE" "$MH_STR"').

GUI KEYBINDINGS:
  key      function
  q        Quit
  h/left   Prev page
  l/right  Next page
  v        Run --file-pager
  d        Run --file-display
  p        Progress pager
  u        Un-answer current page
  w        Write out decisions
  ?        Help pager
  C-r      Rename current file

NOTES:
  Temp files are created respecting envvar TMPDIR (eg. "/home/jacob/mytmp").
