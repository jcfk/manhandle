USAGE:
  manhandle [OPTION...] multi-choice [--choice CHOICE]... FILE...
  manhandle [OPTION...] short-answer --cmd CMD FILE...
  manhandle [OPTION...] fuzzy-finder --action CMD FILE...

DESCRIPTION:
  An ergonomic interface for making manual decisions over lists of files.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
  A sequence of navigable pages is created from the list of filenames. For each
  page, an answer or decision is to provided via the decision interface, the
  nature of which is determined by the chosen decision paradigm. Action is then
  taken on the file, incorporating or entirely determined by the decision.
  Actions can be executed immediately at decision time or by writing out at the
  end.

  Several convenience keybinds including file display and a progress pager are
  provided.

OPTIONS:
  --editor EDITOR        This argument overrides envvar $EDITOR.
  --file-pager CMD       Run this in a child shell and open stdout in a pager
                         (default: stat "$MH_FILE").
  --file-display CMD     Run this in a child shell (default: none).
  --execute-immediately  Execute decisions upon entry, instead of waiting to
                         write out.
  --help                 Print this message.

PARADIGM multi-choice:
  Multiple choice binds keys 0-9 to commands through the --choice option.

  OPTIONS:
    --choice CHOICE  Format CHOICE like n:cmd (eg. '1:rm "$MH_FILE"') to
                     bind digit n ([0-9]) to cmd.

PARADIGM short-answer:
  Short-answer exports a given string as MH_STR.

  OPTIONS:
    --cmd CMD  Execute CMD per file, where CMD references both $MH_FILE and
               $MH_STR (eg. 'mv "$MH_FILE" "$MH_STR"').

PARADIGM fuzzy-finder:
  The decision interface is created by executing the required --fuzzy-finder
  command, from which standard output is captured (minus a trailing newline, if
  any). The current file name is exported as MH_FILE prior to executing the
  command.

  Action is taken by executing the required --action command. The current file
  name is exported as MH_FILE and the selected string is exported as MH_STR
  prior to executing the command.

  OPTIONS:
    --fuzzy-finder CMD  This command is executed to create the fuzzy finder
                        interface (eg. 'find sync -type d | fzf').
    --action CMD        This command is executed when taking action
                        (eg. 'mv "$MH_FILE" "$MH_STR"').

GUI KEYBINDINGS:
  key      function
  q        Quit
  h/left   Prev page
  l/right  Next page
  v        Run --file-pager
  d        Run --file-display
  p        Progress pager
  u        Un-answer current page
  w        Write out decisions
  ?        Help pager
  C-r      Rename current file

NOTES:
  Temp files are created respecting envvar TMPDIR (eg. "/home/jacob/mytmp").
